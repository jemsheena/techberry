### Project Description
Managing crowds at bus stops and ensuring that passengers enter and exit in an organized manner is a significant challenge. During peak hours, overcrowding, unauthorized travel, and mismanagement of passenger flow often lead to inefficiency, security risks, and revenue losses for transportation services. A robust and automated system is needed to regulate entry and exit, prevent unauthorized access, and streamline the ticketing process.

### The Problem statement
Traditional bus ticketing systems often cause long waiting times for passengers. People typically stand in queues to buy tickets, which can be both time-consuming and frustrating. Moreover, there is no easy way to track or verify if passengers have valid tickets after they board the bus, leading to potential fare evasion.

### The Solution
The U BUS system eliminates the need for physical tickets and long queues. By using QR codes, passengers can instantly generate tickets directly from their mobile devices. The system calculates the fare based on the user's current location and destination, making the process faster and more transparent. Additionally, by scanning the exit QR code at the destination, passengers' entries and exits are validated, ensuring that only ticketed passengers board and exit the bus.
